# Data Versions Cleaner

At some point we need to do housekeeping of large tables in our website especially versions table.

## Requirements

* SilverStripe ^4.0

## Installation

```
composer require ssmarco/data-cleaner
```

## License
See [License](license.md)

We have included a 3-clause BSD license you can use as a default. We advocate for the BSD license as 
it is one of the most permissive and open licenses.

Feel free to alter the [license.md](license.md) to suit if you wan to use an alternative license.

## Documentation
 * [Documentation readme](docs/en/readme.md)

Add links into your docs/<language> folder here unless your module only requires minimal documentation 
in that case, add here and remove the docs folder. You might use this as a quick table of content if you
mhave multiple documentation pages.

## Example configuration (optional)
If your module makes use of the config API in SilverStripe it's a good idea to provide an example config
 here that will get the module working out of the box and expose the user to the possible configuration options.

Provide a yaml code example where possible.

```yaml

Marcz\Cleaner\DataVersionCleanerTask:
  RecordClass: 'SilverStripe\Blog\Model\BlogPost'
  VersionsToKeep: 5
```

Or execute in your terminal
```bash
sake dev/tasks/Marcz-Cleaner-DataVersionCleanerTask '' RecordClass='SilverStripe\Blog\Model\BlogPost' VersionsToKeep=3
```
